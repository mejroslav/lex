## Lex - Regex Word Finder
***Author: Miroslav Burýšek***
*(Documentation generated by CHAT-GPT3)*

`lex` is a Python script that allows you to find words matching a specified regular expression pattern in a database of English words. It provides a simple command-line interface to search and manipulate word lists based on regular expressions.

### Usage

To use `lex`, run the script with the desired command-line arguments:

```
python lex.py [-h] [-p PATTERN] [-l LIMIT] [-r] [-d DELIMITER] [--cheatsheet]
```

The available command-line arguments are as follows:

- `-p PATTERN`, `--pattern PATTERN`: Specifies the regular expression pattern to match against the words in the database.
- `-l LIMIT`, `--limit LIMIT`: Limits the number of matched words to display. By default, it shows all the matching words.
- `-r`, `--random`: Randomizes the order of the matched words.
- `-d DELIMITER`, `--delimiter DELIMITER`: Sets the delimiter used to separate the matched words in the output. The default delimiter is a space.
- `--cheatsheet`: Displays a regex cheatsheet.

### Regular Expression Cheatsheet

The script also provides a regex cheatsheet that you can access using the `--cheatsheet` flag. It includes commonly used regex syntax and patterns.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use `lex` to find words matching a specific pattern:

```shell
python3 lex.py -p "^ca\w+" -l 5 -r
```

This command searches for words that start with "ca" in the database, limits the output to 5 random matches, and displays the result:
```
catatonic calcifuge cartel cavy catapultic
```

### Database

The English words database used by `lex` is derived from the database https://www.diginoodles.com/projects/eowl stored in the file `english-words/words.txt`. You can modify the path to the file as needed to provide your own database or use a different word list.

Feel free to modify and adapt the script according to your requirements.

**Note:** The script assumes that you have Python 3 installed on your system and that you have the necessary dependencies available.
